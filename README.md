## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:


- `src/main/java/com/yourusername/dsalibrary/algorithms`: Contains algorithm implementations.
- `src/main/java/com/yourusername/dsalibrary/datastructures`: Contains data structure implementations.
- `test/java/com/yourusername/dsalibrary/algorithms`: Contains tests for algorithm implementations.
- `test/java/com/yourusername/dsalibrary/datastructures`: Contains tests for data structure implementations.

## Usage

To use a specific data structure or algorithm, you can instantiate the corresponding class from the `com.yourusername.dsalibrary` package. Make sure to add the necessary dependencies to your project.

Example:

```java
import com.yourusername.dsalibrary.algorithms.Sorting;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5};
        Sorting.quickSort(array);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
    }
}
